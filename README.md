# k-means-algorithm-example
This project is based on the Google Advanced Data analytics certification training assignment. The aim of the project: to partition a dataset with information about penguins and check how many species of penguins are collected in the dataset and whether there are hidden relationships.
It was found that in addition to the difference in parameters between species, there is also sexual dimorphism (difference between male and female). For this reason, the most optimal number of clusters was determined to be 6 rather than 3 (the dataset contained data on three penguin species). Since the task was clustering, one of the clustering algorithms, k-means, was chosen.
Implementation: sklearn.cluster.KMeans().
